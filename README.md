Real-Time Face Recognition Using DeepFace

This project uses OpenCV and DeepFace to perform real-time face verification through a webcam. It continuously compares frames from the live video feed with a reference image and provides instant feedback on whether a match is detected.

Features:
- Real-time face recognition using DeepFace.
- Multi-threaded processing for better performance.
- Displays "MATCH!" or "NO MATCH!" on the video feed.
- Press 'q' to exit the program.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
- DeepFace: pip install deepface

Setup & Usage:
1. Place a reference image named "reference.jpg" in the project directory.
2. Run the script using:
   python main.py
3. If the detected face matches the reference image, "MATCH!" appears in green; otherwise, "NO MATCH!" appears in red.
4. Press 'q' to close the program.

Notes & Limitations:
- Ensure good lighting conditions for better accuracy.
- The reference image should be clear and well-lit.
- Works best with frontal face images.

Future Enhancements:
- Support for multiple reference images.
- Improved face detection speed and accuracy.
- A GUI-based interface for better user experience.

if error 
Just run the .verify() it will trigger the download part, 
Then run the whole code again
